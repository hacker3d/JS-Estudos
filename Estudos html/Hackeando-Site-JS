        <p>Each of your Git projects has two parts: the files and directories that you create and edit directly, and the extra information that Git records about the project's history. The combination of these two things is called a repository. Git stores
            all of its extra information in a directory called .git located in the root directory of the repository. Git expects this information to be laid out in a very precise way, so you should never edit or delete anything in .git. Suppose your home
            directory /home/repl contains a repository called dental, which has a sub-directory called data. Where is information about the history of the files in /home/repl/dental/data stored? </p>
